## Features
- âœ¨ Auto write/rewrite when you import a file (with special comments)
- ðŸš€ Seamlessly integrate with Vite plugins and work with your preferred frameworks (tested with React and Vue)



## Demo
Using `gpt-4o`.

## Usage
The recommended way using this package is `vite-plugin-co`

```sh
npm install @co-ai/vite-plugin-co
```

Setup the plugin.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import coPlugin from '@co-ai/vite-plugin-co'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // ...
    coPlugin({
      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // any OpenAI model like `gpt-4o`
      apiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY',
      include: './**/*' // files to inspect
      ignore: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/.vscode', '**/.git/**'] // default
    }),
    // ...
  ],
})
```

Run vite server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then import a file (existing or not both OK) you want ask AI to write for you with comments.

```js
// co
import { sayHello } from "./path-to-file.js"
import User from "./User.js" // multiple files are OK
// co-end

sayHello()
```

AI will write `./path-to-file.js` which export `sayHello` function.

If you don't need AI to write for you and prefer to edit yourself, simply remove the import statement from the comment block.

```js
// co
import User from "./User.js" // multiple files are OK
// co-end

import { sayHello } from "./path-to-file.js" // You have the control now

sayHello()
```

> [!WARNING]
> Only support relative path currently

## How this works ?
`Co` will generate the referenced code based on how it is used. You don't need to think about a prompt for every generated file.

```js
// Write down how you will use the imported code.

// co
import User from "./User.js"
// co-end

const user = new User("My name", 20)

user.sayHello()
```

```js
// The generated code possibly be...
export default class User {
  constructor(name, age){
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }

  sayHello(){
    console.log(`Hello my name is ${this.name}`)
  }
}
```

You can also add hints in comments, which Co will consider when generating code.

```js
// Write down how you will use the imported code.

// co
import User from "./User.js"
// co-end

const user = new User("My name", 20)

user.sayHello() // Hello every one, my name is ${name}. Nice to meet you.
```
